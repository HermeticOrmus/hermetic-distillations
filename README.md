# Hermetic Distillations

Reusable skills, patterns, and frameworks extracted from real AI-assisted development sessions using category theory and the golden ratio.

This is not a collection of theoretical exercises. Every distillation here was forged in production work -- debugging, building, researching, shipping. The ephemeral became eternal through a structured extraction process.

## What Is Distillation?

Distillation is the art of extracting reusable patterns from ephemeral sessions. It uses:

- **Category Theory** -- Functors preserve structure across transformations. The distillation functor `D: Session -> Artifacts` maps concrete operations to abstract, reusable patterns while preserving composition.
- **The Golden Ratio** -- Complexity scoring via `(Operations x Decisions x Iterations) / 5` classifies artifacts by potency: Commands (< 0.618), Skills (0.618-1.618), Agents (> 1.618).
- **Information Theory** -- Entropy reduction (compress the session) while preserving mutual information (keep the essence). At least 61.8% of session information must survive distillation.

The four stages follow the alchemical opus: **Nigredo** (dissolve the session into patterns), **Albedo** (purify concrete operations into abstractions), **Citrinitas** (classify by golden ratio), **Rubedo** (generate the artifact).

| Skill | Description | Potency | Origin |

## How to Use

These are [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/claude-code) skills. To use one:

1. Copy the skill directory to `~/.claude/skills/`
2. Invoke by name (e.g., `/product-feasibility-scout`)
3. Or read the SKILL.md and apply the framework manually

Each skill is self-contained with clear instructions, templates, quality criteria, and anti-patterns.

## The Distillation Process

Want to distill your own sessions? The process:

```
1. NIGREDO   -- Dissolve: What patterns exist in this session?
2. ALBEDO    -- Purify: What's the invariant essence vs. the variant parameters?
3. CITRINITAS -- Classify: Complexity score -> Command / Skill / Agent
4. RUBEDO    -- Generate: Produce the artifact from templates
5. VALIDATE  -- Potency >= 0.75 or iterate
```

The full distillation methodology is available as a Claude Code skill: [`/distill`](https://github.com/HermeticOrmus/hermetic-distillations/wiki/Distillation-Methodology) (link to wiki, coming soon).

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). Distillations should:

- Emerge from real work (not invented for the repo)
- Include an "Origin" section documenting the source session
- Pass the potency threshold (>= 0.75)
- Follow the Gold Hat philosophy: empower, never extract
