# Claude Distillations

A collection of reusable Claude Code skills distilled from real development sessions.

## Structure

- Each skill lives in its own directory with a `SKILL.md`
- README.md contains the catalog table -- update it when adding skills
- Every skill must have an Origin section documenting its source

## Adding a New Skill

1. Create directory: `<skill-name>/SKILL.md`
2. Add entry to the Catalog table in README.md
3. Commit: `feat(distill): add <skill-name> -- <one-line description>`

## Standards

- Skills must pass potency threshold (>= 0.75)
- Skills must emerge from real work (not theoretical)
- Follow existing SKILL.md format (frontmatter + sections)
- Gold Hat: empower, never extract
