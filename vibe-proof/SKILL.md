# Vibe-Proof: Security Hardening for Full-Stack Apps

**Purpose:** Systematically audit and fix security vulnerabilities in vibe-coded
full-stack applications through parallel multi-agent analysis and guided remediation.

## Origin

Extracted from a real hardening session on a React + Express + Stripe e-commerce
platform deployed to Vercel. The audit found 61 issues across frontend, backend,
and config layers -- including a SQL injection vector, hardcoded PII, API tokens
in URLs, `.env` files tracked in git, and 45+ unstructured console.log calls.
All fixed in a single session with parallel agent scanning. (Feb 2026)

## When to Use

- After vibe-coding an MVP with API routes, databases, or payment integrations
- Before first real deployment or first real customer
- When you suspect "it works but is it safe?"
- Any Express/React/Next.js/Nuxt app with a backend

## The Seven Security Checks

### 1. Injection Vectors
- [ ] No user input in SQL/query strings without parameterization
- [ ] Sort columns, filter fields use whitelist validation
- [ ] No `eval()`, `new Function()`, or template literal injection
- [ ] URL params parsed with bounds checking (parseInt with min/max)

### 2. PII & Secret Exposure
- [ ] No hardcoded addresses, phone numbers, names in source
- [ ] API tokens in headers (Authorization), never in URL params
- [ ] No `.env` files tracked in git (check `git ls-files | grep env`)
- [ ] No secrets in client-side code or VITE_* vars that shouldn't be public
- [ ] `.env.example` documents all required variables

### 3. Missing Security Headers
- [ ] `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- [ ] `X-Frame-Options: DENY` (or SAMEORIGIN if iframes needed)
- [ ] `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
- [ ] `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
- [ ] `Strict-Transport-Security` (HSTS) on production
- [ ] Body size limits on `express.json()` and `express.urlencoded()`

### 4. Error Leakage
- [ ] Production error responses don't expose stack traces
- [ ] 500 errors return generic message, not `error.message`
- [ ] No `console.log` of sensitive data (tokens, passwords, PII)
- [ ] Structured logger used instead of console.* in production code

### 5. Input Validation Gaps
- [ ] All POST/PUT endpoints validate body with Zod or equivalent
- [ ] Query params have type coercion and bounds (limit, offset, id)
- [ ] Integer params checked against MAX_INT (2147483647)
- [ ] Enum params validated against allowed values
- [ ] File uploads have size and type restrictions

### 6. Dead Code & Attack Surface
- [ ] Unused routes/endpoints removed
- [ ] Unused components deleted (not commented out)
- [ ] Disabled features removed entirely (not just `if(false)`)
- [ ] Test/debug endpoints not in production
- [ ] Unused npm packages removed

### 7. Credential Hygiene
- [ ] Session secrets are 32+ characters
- [ ] Cookies: `httpOnly`, `secure` (production), `sameSite: 'lax'`
- [ ] Trust proxy configured when behind reverse proxy (Vercel, nginx)
- [ ] Webhook endpoints verify signatures (Stripe, etc.)
- [ ] Rate limiting on auth, checkout, and newsletter endpoints

## Execution Process

### Phase 1: Parallel Audit (Read-Only)

Launch 3 specialized agents in parallel to scan different layers simultaneously:

**Agent 1: Frontend Audit**
```
Audit the frontend code for security issues:
- XSS vectors (dangerouslySetInnerHTML, unescaped user input)
- Sensitive data in client-side code
- Tracking pixels with undefined variables
- Console.log statements leaking data
- Dead/unused components
- API keys or tokens in VITE_* env vars that shouldn't be public
Report each issue with file:line, severity, and fix suggestion.
```

**Agent 2: Backend/API Audit**
```
Audit the backend code for security issues:
- SQL injection (user input in query strings, unvalidated sort/filter)
- Missing input validation on POST/PUT endpoints
- Hardcoded PII (addresses, phone numbers, names)
- API tokens in URL params instead of headers
- Console.log/error statements (should use structured logger)
- Error handlers leaking internal details
- Missing rate limiting on sensitive endpoints
- Webhook signature verification
Report each issue with file:line, severity, and fix suggestion.
```

**Agent 3: Config & Credential Audit**
```
Audit configuration and credentials:
- .env files tracked in git (git ls-files | grep env)
- Security headers present/missing
- Body size limits configured
- Session configuration (secret length, cookie flags)
- Trust proxy setting
- Dead code files (unused components, disabled features)
- Unused npm dependencies
Report each issue with file:line, severity, and fix suggestion.
```

### Phase 2: Synthesize & Prioritize

Combine all findings into a single prioritized list:

| Priority | Category | Fix Order |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| CRITICAL | Injection, credential leaks, undefined vars | Fix first |
| HIGH | PII exposure, missing validation, error leakage | Fix second |
| MEDIUM | Console.log, dead code, missing headers | Fix third |
| LOW | Unused packages, config optimization | Fix last |

### Phase 3: Systematic Fix Execution

Fix in priority order. After each fix category:
1. Run `npm run build` (or project equivalent)
2. Verify no regressions

**Common Fix Patterns:**

#### SQL Injection (Whitelist Pattern)
```typescript
const ALLOWED_SORT_COLUMNS: Record<string, string> = {
  'created': 'created_at',
  'rating': 'average_rating',
  'name': 'name',
  'price': 'price::numeric',
};

if (filters?.sortBy && ALLOWED_SORT_COLUMNS[filters.sortBy]) {
  const sortColumn = ALLOWED_SORT_COLUMNS[filters.sortBy];
  query += ` ORDER BY ${sortColumn}`;
}
```

#### PII Extraction (Env Var Pattern)
```typescript
// BEFORE: Hardcoded PII
const SENDER = { name: 'John Doe', street: '123 Main St' };

// AFTER: Environment variables with safe fallbacks
const SENDER = {
  name: process.env.SENDER_NAME || 'Company Name',
  street: process.env.SENDER_STREET || '',
};
```

#### API Token in Header (Not URL)
```typescript
// BEFORE: Token in URL (visible in logs, browser history)
const url = `${API_URL}?access_token=${TOKEN}`;

// AFTER: Token in Authorization header
const url = API_URL;
headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${TOKEN}` }
```

#### Security Headers Middleware
```typescript
app.use((_req, res, next) => {
  res.setHeader('X-Content-Type-Options', 'nosniff');
  res.setHeader('X-Frame-Options', 'DENY');
  res.setHeader('X-XSS-Protection', '1; mode=block');
  res.setHeader('Referrer-Policy', 'strict-origin-when-cross-origin');
  res.setHeader('Strict-Transport-Security', 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains');
  next();
});
```

#### Console.log Migration
```typescript
// BEFORE
console.log('Processing order:', orderId);
console.error('Failed:', error);

// AFTER (structured logger)
logger.info('Processing order', { orderId });
logger.error('Failed', { error });
```

#### Error Response Masking
```typescript
app.use((err, _req, res, _next) => {
  const status = err.status || 500;
  const message = err.message || 'Internal Server Error';
  // Don't leak internals in production
  res.status(status).json({
    error: status >= 500 ? 'Internal Server Error' : message
  });
});
```

### Phase 4: Credential Remediation

If `.env` files were tracked in git:
```bash
# Add to .gitignore
echo ".env.production" >> .gitignore

# Remove from tracking (keeps local file)
git rm --cached .env.production

# Alert: Rotate ALL exposed credentials
```

**Credentials that MUST be rotated if exposed:**
- Database passwords
- API keys (Stripe, Shippo, Resend, etc.)
- Session secrets
- Webhook signing secrets

### Phase 5: Environment Variable Provisioning

If deploying to Vercel, set env vars via API:
```bash
# Get project ID
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $VERCEL_TOKEN" \
  "https://api.vercel.com/v9/projects?teamId=$TEAM_ID" | \
  jq '.projects[] | select(.name == "PROJECT_NAME") | .id'

# Set env var
curl -s -X POST \
  "https://api.vercel.com/v10/projects/$PROJECT_ID/env?teamId=$TEAM_ID" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $VERCEL_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"key": "VAR_NAME", "value": "VAR_VALUE", "type": "encrypted", "target": ["production", "preview"]}'
```

### Phase 6: Verify & Deploy

```bash
# Build verification
npm run build

# Commit (conventional commit format)
git commit -m "fix(security): harden platform -- [summary of fixes]"

# Push and deploy
git push origin main
```

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Build passes with zero warnings
- [ ] No user input reaches SQL without parameterization or whitelist
- [ ] No PII in source code
- [ ] No API tokens in URLs
- [ ] No .env files tracked in git
- [ ] Security headers present on all responses
- [ ] All console.* replaced with structured logger
- [ ] Error responses don't leak internals
- [ ] All POST/PUT endpoints validate input
- [ ] Dead code deleted (not commented)
- [ ] Exposed credentials rotated

## Lessons Learned

1. **Parallel audit agents save massive time.** 3 agents scanning different layers simultaneously catches issues that sequential review misses.

2. **Sort columns are the #1 SQL injection vector in vibe-coded apps.** Everyone parameterizes WHERE clauses but forgets ORDER BY.

3. **`.env` files in git are shockingly common.** Always check `git ls-files | grep -i env` as the very first step.

4. **Console.log migration is tedious but critical.** 45+ calls across 7 files is typical for a vibe-coded MVP. Batch it with a dedicated agent.

5. **Vercel API for env vars is faster than the dashboard.** One curl loop sets 10 variables in seconds vs. clicking through the UI.

6. **Check BOTH server entry points.** Many projects have `server/index.ts` (dev) AND `server/api-entry.ts` (serverless). Security headers must be on both.

7. **Meta Pixel tracking bugs are invisible until checkout.** The `total` variable undefined before declaration pattern is easy to miss because the page still loads -- it just sends `undefined` to Facebook.
